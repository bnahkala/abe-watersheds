# ABE 431 Watershed Delineation Demo
*Adapted from Andrew Murray, UNC*

# Background

Watershed delineations can be performed by hand or by using GIS software. The most common software applied in engineering practice is ArcGIS. Other GIS software includes the open source QGIS software. However, programming languages such as *R* also offer geospatial capabilities. Of major significance is the *R* package 'whitebox.' While these tools are not applied as frequently in consulting, they are incredibly powerful and are parts of active research in academia. 

# Objectives

1. Expose students to alternative geoprocessing methods. 
2. Demonstrate the principles of watershed delineation as applied in hydrologic studies. 

# Outcomes

1. Knowledge of watershed delineation methods. 
2. Increased programming knowledge. 
3. Knowledge of active research methods. 

# Examples

1. Visualize the delineated watershed.
